= JAX-RS Analyzer system test

This system test verifies the correct functionality of both the build JAX-RS Analyzer Maven plugin and the standalone version.

== Config
The configuration is done in `config.json`.
That file contains Maven's repository location, the used version for the JAX-RS analyzer and the test scenario setup including all options for the runs.

The test scenarios are tested against the files under `scenarios/`.
The scenario configuration done in `config.json` requires that the files `xx_expected` -- with `xx` as the index (two digits with leading zero) -- exist.

== Run
Run by executing `./run-test.sh`. Requires the Nashorn scripting engine (`jjs`).

== Extend
Extend the scenarios array in `config.json` and create new files under `scenarios/` accordingly.
